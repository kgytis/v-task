# v-task

Program written in Python 3.11.1 using Jupiter Notebook, so these are necessary to run the program.

There are two ways of running the program:

  1. Run map-reduce-dev.ipynb jupiter notebook cells in written order (to ensure that everything works correct). This approach will show some intermediate      data transformations + easier to follow my thinking path to solve the task.
  
  2. Run single-run-file.ipynb jupiter notebook single cell, which output would be the same (2 csv files).
